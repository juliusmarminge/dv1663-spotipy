# spotipy

## ideas

- **users** can sign up and create an **account** on the app
- **accounts** can create **playlists** and add **songs** to their **playlist**.
- **songs** are created by **artists** and published in **albums** (singles are represented as single-song-albums)
- **albums** contain metadata such as **release date**, **description**, **genres** **(more?)**
- **users** can like **albums**, **artists** and **songs** to "save" them to their **library**, which also contains the **users's** **playlists**

### functions / procedures

## implementation alternatives

- an api or sdk to fetch data?
- web-view w/ an actual music player?
  - how to store the actual songs? url's to youtube or similar? encode the data?
